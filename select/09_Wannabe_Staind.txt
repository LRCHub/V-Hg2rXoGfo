I'm selling records
What is it that you do?
Sitting in your mama's basement with a shiatsu
Peanut butter on your dick
Right hand going click
With your left hand giving you a rim job
So now you wanna talk about me
Who's name is on the marque
You hate everything that you can't be
I've heard enough!
You're just a sell-out, turn-coat rockstar!
Pussy, poser rockstar!
Because you're nothing but a wannabe
You're so easy when you're faceless
Why don't you focus on your misery?
Instead of focusing on me
So number two, that's right
What is it you're rolling?
Now that your mama's Ford Focus got stolen
Well, it don't matter because you got nowhere to go
So back to hating, frantic masturbating
So now you wanna talk about me
You know the songs that you download for free
You hate everything that you can't be
I've heard enough!
You're just a sell-out, turn-coat rockstar!
Pussy, poser rockstar!
Because you're nothing but a wannabe
You're so easy when you're faceless
Why don't you focus on your misery?
Instead of focusing on me
So number two that's right
What is it you're rolling?
Now that your mama's Ford Focus got stolen
But, it don't matter because you got nowhere to go
So back to hating, frantic masturbating
So now you wanna talk about me
So now you wanna talk about me
Because you're nothing but a wannabe
It's so easy when you're faceless
Why don't you focus on your misery?
Instead of focusing on me
Nothing but a wannabe
It's so easy when you're faceless
Why don't you focus on your misery?
Instead of focusing on me
