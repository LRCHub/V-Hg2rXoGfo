Big hit on the radio
Big man with a license to deceive
You taste like a perfect chocolate cake

You are the only one
So godd and gracious a man can be
Born with the silver spoon in your mouth

Bridge:

Systematic breakdown
Television hero
A second of your life

Refrain:

I don't wanna be a wannabe like you
It feels fine just to be myself
I don't wanna be a wannabe like you
I'm sinner, that's good to me
A.S.S.H.O.L.E.
I don't wanna be a wannabe like you
A.S.S.H.O.L.E.
Read my mouth

Handshake in a mirror ball
Sounds in each corner of this room
You are a bunch of man I know

Must have many skeletons
In the closet with the golden key
Exaggeration is your second name
